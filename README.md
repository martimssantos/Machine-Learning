## Project description
<p align="justify">In this challenge, your goal is to build a predictive model that answers the question,
“Who are the people more likely to suffer from the Smith Parasite?”. With that
goal, you can access a small quantity of sociodemographic, health, and behavioral
information obtained from the patients.

<p align="justify">As data scientists, your team is asked to analyze and transform the data available as
needed and apply different models to answer the defined question in a more accurate
way. Can you build a model that can predict if a patient will suffer, or not, from the
Smith Disease?

The score of your predictions is the percentage of instances you correctly predict,
using the f1 score.
